üìß Simple Spam Filter
=====================

A client-side web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that attempts to identify spam messages using a set of predefined regular expressions. It includes advanced pattern matching for common spammer obfuscation techniques.

‚ú® Features
----------

*   **Spam Detection:** Analyzes user-entered messages against a comprehensive list of spam-related keywords and patterns.
    
*   **Flexible Regex Matching:** Uses a custom function (createFlexibleRegex) to generate robust regular expressions that account for common spammer tricks like:
    
    *   Character substitutions (e.g., e for 3, s for 5, a for @).
        
    *   Interspersed non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., f.r.e.e money).
        
*   **Advanced Pattern Recognition:** Includes regexes for:
    
    *   Various financial and scam-related terms.
        
    *   Numeric patterns for currency amounts (e.g., $1000, ¬£500).
        
    *   Excessive capitalization (e.g., FREE MONEY).
        
    *   Suspicious URL patterns (e.g., common URL shorteners, long obfuscated paths).
        
    *   Excessive punctuation (e.g., !!!, $$$).
        
*   **Real-time Feedback:** Instantly informs the user whether a message is likely spam or not.
    
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and clean design for easy message input and result display.
    
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
    

üöÄ Technologies Used
