🔢 Decimal to Binary Converter with Call Stack Animation
A web-based application that converts decimal numbers to their binary equivalents. What makes this converter unique is its interactive animation, which visually demonstrates the recursive process of decimal to binary conversion, mimicking a function call stack.

✨ Features
Decimal to Binary Conversion: Accurately converts non-negative decimal integers to binary.

Interactive Call Stack Animation: Visualizes the recursive steps involved in the conversion process, showing how function calls are added to and removed from a conceptual call stack.

Input Validation: Ensures that only valid non-negative decimal numbers are processed.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be usable across different screen sizes.

🚀 Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the structure of the web page.

CSS3: Styles the application, including the layout, colors, typography, and the animation effects.

JavaScript (ES6+): Implements the core conversion logic (recursion) and controls the dynamic animation of the call stack.

📁 Project Structure
.
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js

index.html: The main HTML file, containing the input field, convert button, result display, and the container for the call stack animation.

style.css: Defines the visual presentation of the application, including the styling for the input elements, buttons, result display, and the animated call stack frames.

script.js: Contains the JavaScript functions for decimal to binary conversion, input validation, and the logic to generate and control the step-by-step call stack animation.

⚙️ Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

Open in Browser:

Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. No server setup is required as it's a client-side application.

💡 Usage
Enter a Decimal Number: Type a non-negative integer into the input field.

Convert: Click the "Convert" button or press Enter.

Observe Animation: Watch the "Call Stack" section as the animation unfolds, showing each recursive call, its return value, and its removal from the stack.

View Result: The final binary conversion will be displayed at the top of the output section.
