üöÄ Technologies Used
--------------------

*   **HTML5:** Provides the semantic structure of the web application.
    
*   **CSS3:** Styles the application, including responsive design, custom dropdowns, loading animations, and theme management using CSS variables.
    
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles all interactive logic, including form submission, API calls to Hugging Face, dynamic image rendering, and theme toggling.
    
*   **Hugging Face Inference API:** The backend service used for AI image generation.
    
*   **Font Awesome:** For various icons used throughout the interface.
    

üìÅ Project Structure
--------------------
*   index.html: The main HTML file that structures the AI Image Generator, including the header, prompt input area, model/count/ratio selectors, and the image gallery grid.
    
*   style.css: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the application. This includes global variables for theming, responsive adjustments, custom styles for inputs and buttons, and animations for loading states and hover effects.
    
*   script.js: Implements the core JavaScript logic. This includes handling user input, making asynchronous requests to the Hugging Face API, processing generated image data, dynamically updating the UI with images, and managing theme preferences via local storage.
    

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
-------------------------

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
2.  cd YOUR_REPO_NAME (Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)
    
3.  **Get a Hugging Face API Key:**
    
    *   Go to Hugging Face Website: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
        
    *   Sign up or log in.
        
    *   Generate a new access token (ensure it has "read" permissions, or "write" if you plan to use models that require it, though "read" is usually sufficient for inference).
        
    *   **Important:** Keep your API key secure and do not expose it publicly in client-side code if deploying to production without a proxy. For local development, it's fine.
